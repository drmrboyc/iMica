iMica
=============

A FinViz.com scraper / data wareehouse. iMica performs scheduled scans and stores information on each filter & option for every stock on the US Markets.

### Why?

- By storing thousands of attribute values from each stock on a daily basis iMica can find values commonly shared by stocks just before they exhibit desirable price movements.

- Using this large amount of data iMica can then predict future stock movements based on a large dataset. The larger the dataset used in prediction the more accurate the prediction will be.
